IMPORTANT INFORMATION BEFORE STARTING

1) AutodockTool1.5.2 (ADT) has to be installed on the mashine this program is running to be able to use the ADT scripts in the pre-docking procedure. The corresponding environnement variables have to be set as well. 

The installation of ADT has been included in the pre-docking procedure (see bellow). Also, it can be installed manually (preferred). PLEASE, check ADTinstall.out for more information + to VERIFY the success of the installation.

Because of bad environment variable setting you might get this kind of error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/$USER/PROJECT/mgltools_i86Linux2_1.5.2/MGLToolsPckgs/mglutil/splashregister/license.py", line 20, in <module>
    tk_root = Tkinter.Tk()
  File "/home/$USER/PROJECT/mgltools_i86Linux2_1.5.2/lib/python2.5/lib-tk/Tkinter.py", line 1636, in __init__
    self.tk = _tkinter.create(screenName, baseName, className, interactive, wantobjects, useTk, sync, use)
_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable

2) You might need to use ADT GUI to define the size and the center of the grids manually.
   If you encounter problems with ADT GUI v1.5.2, please use ADT GUI v1.5.4 

3) WARNING: There is a bug in ADT in GridParameters.py
   When executing prepare_gpf4.dpf, you get this:

File Format unknown can't parse it
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/$USER//PROJECT/mgltools_i86Linux2_1.5.2/MGLToolsPckgs/AutoDockTools/Utilities24//prepare_gpf4.py", line 96, in <module>
    gpfm.set_types_from_directory(directory)
  File "/home/$USER/PROJECT/mgltools_i86Linux2_1.5.2/MGLToolsPckgs/AutoDockTools/GridParameters.py", line 918, in set_types_from_directory
    m = Read(f)[0]
IndexError: list index out of range

   Because in GridParameters.py, line 918, you have to replace "pdb*" with "pdbqt"

4) Before executing "qsub launch_docking.csh", you will have to modify the path to the input data and executable.

==============================================================================
WHAT TO DO 
==============================================================================

1) Copy the PROJECT directory in your HOME directory

2) In your HOME directory, execute these 3 commands to reproduce the results I sent:

> cd ~/PROJECT
> ./pre-docking
> qsub launch_docking
> ./post-docking

The output of each command is well commented/documented

Also, you should check the *err file in ~/PROJECT to VERIFY if errors occured
